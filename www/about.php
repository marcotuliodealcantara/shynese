<p>Learning Chinese, like any other language, usually goes through some well-known phases. In the beginning, everything is wonderful. Since we know nothing, any dozen words are quite a revolution already.</p> 

<p>We move on to the next phase, when we learn the first 50 to 100 words and we begin to feel awesome and excited. Nevertheless we start to feel the difficulty on grammar and to understand what others say. But with some effort we outome this and we usually have the first experiences understanding a spoken sentence.</p> 

<p>Here is the third phase, when we are trying to leave basics and get into the intermediate. This is the moment when we know about 300 to 400 words. We can build sentences now and we're dying to use the language in a really useful way. But we still can't do it. We yet don't have the "ear" ready enough, we can't understand longer sentences, catch the nuances, the slangs, and we still get confused on how to speak. This lasts from a few months to maybe years, it's what I consider the most challenging phase and it's where the vast majority of students drop out.</p> 

<p>If we can persist this, we then got ourselves into the advanced level, the last phase. Now we know about 1.000 to 2.000 words. It's very rewarding when we can communicate, understand each other. We can use the language for work, fun and even make our own jokes! This last phase has it's own levels, and we can get years to really master the idiom, to reach fluency. But at least we are already enjoying the work done. Talking to people, watching movies, making friends, doing business.</p> 

<p>As I didn't get there yet, in Mandarin, I decided to combine my interest in the language with my passion for developing digital projects and then I created this website. In my experience in learning Chinese, with it's simpler grammar but the tones and writing "nightmare", I soon realized that the big thing for learning this language is "vocabulary". This is what really takes you out of intermediate level and puts you in the advanced level. Memorize vocabulary, learn words. Learn, learn and learn some more. Build as much vocabulary as you can.</p> 

<p>Focusing on vocabulary formation, I present Shynese.net, Chinese for shy people. "If you don't feel comfortable to go out there and talk to strangers, this website is for you". Create your account and start building your own word bank. Along with this, do flashcards. As much as you can on a week. Learn 2000 words and you will have reached the advanced level!</p>

<p>One more warning, just don't forget to study tones, writing and grammar as well.</p> 

<p>Enjoy, I wish you a good learning!</p>
